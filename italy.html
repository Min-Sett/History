    <p class="sub-title">History</p>
    
    Culture proof was found far in pre-History in the Italian peninsula. In the Alpine zones of Lombardy, a considerable number of shake drawings discovered date to around 8,000 BC. During the Copper Age (37th and fifteenth hundreds of years BC), Bronze Ages (fifteenth and eighth hundreds of years BC), and the Iron Ages (eighth to fifth century BC), there were impressive settlements. All through northern Italy, Etruscan human progress has grabbed hold between 800BC, while the Greeks all through southern Italy have lived somewhere in the range of 700BC and 600BC, specifically in Puglia, Calabria, and Sicily.
    
    
    
    <p class="sub-title">The Middle Ages</p>
    
    Italy's concise history started with a progression of attacks in the Middle Ages. The Ostrogoths of 493 attacked the Italian landmass, an eastern Germanic gathering. The consequent Gothic War realized the making of a domain in Northern Italy and three regions in the South by the Lombards, another Germanic collection in 568. Post-development of a free state began by the popes. At the point when the Franks (or the French) got the Lombards defeated in 756, they gave the pope power over Central Italy and built up the ecclesiastical states. The Germanic Roman Empire from A.D. 962 was administered by the northern conditions of Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, and Tuscany.
    
    The most genuine attacks had been over by the center of the eleventh century, and the market kept on flourishing. It has now become four significant business and political focuses, Genoa, Pisa, Amalfi, and Venice. In the twelfth century, freedom was challenged in the Italian towns constrained by the Holy Roman Empire. The result was the gathering of free countries, republics, and city-states in northern Italy.
    
    
    
    <p class="sub-title">Three phases control Italy's long history:</p>
    
    <p class="sub-title">1. The Roman Empire</p>
    
    The Roman Empire Between the 6th and three centuries BCE Italy attacked peninsular Rome in the Italian area, which in the following, quite a while, has extended over the Mediterranean and Western nations. The Roman Empire has commanded from that point forward. The Roman Kingdom would keep on characterizing a significant part of the historical backdrop of Europe and imprint culture and society, which were overpowering in its military and political moving.
    
    In the fifth century, after the Italian area of the Roman Empire weakened and "fell"– an occasion which nobody had ever accomplished such a great deal at the time–Italy was the object of a few intrusions. Some time ago, bound together zone broke into a few littler bodies, including the Catholic Papal States.
    
    
    
    <p class="sub-title">2. The Renaissance</p>
    
    The disparities between the territories are extreme now in our short history of Italy. In contrast to the well-off northern nations, focal and southern Italy are monetarily discouraged. Advancing back to Rome in 1478, the papacy moved quickly to Avignon in France. Unknown forces controlled Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia.
    
    The Italian Renaissance turned into a social development, which extended from Florence to Siena in Tuscany in the XIV century. There have been different factors in its development, including the expansion of Greek scholarly people after the Ottoman Turks involved Constantinople for the second time in 1453. Another factor adding to the sponsorship of expressions of the human experience of the Medici family has been a large group of visionary leaders during this period. Michelangelo Buonarotti, Dante Alighieri, Leonardo Da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Francesco Petrarch, to give some examples. Johannes Gutenberg's improvement of the print machine has prompted a more liberated progression of data during the 1440s.
    
    The Renaissance entered Rome toward the south and urged the popes from Italy to modify their city, with Rome again flourishing. The pattern stretched out to Milan and Venice just as to the extraordinary north of Europe, forming the music, culture, science, government. All through Italy, the authority of Tuscan culture, in the end, turned into the official language of Italy, which is the Tuscan tongue.
    
    <p class="sub-title">The Risorgimento</p>
    
    The Risorgimento or unification of Italy was an entangled procedure that bound together with the different conditions of the Italian peninsula into the cutting edge country of Italy. The Risorgimento was a convoluted procedure. In 1815, the development started with expanding hatred for Austria's standard of the landmass.
    
    Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi are two driving figures in the solidarity procedure. Mazzini, at first, was captured for his contribution to the Secret Society of Carbonari in 1830. He drove an assortment of bombed resistance in Italy from his outcast in France and later Britain, however at long last worked close by Garibaldi in seeking after their unification vision. He attracted 100,000 individuals at his memorial service in 1872.
    
    Giuseppe Garibaldi is, similar to Mazzini, an originator of the Carbonari mystery society. After a bombed revolt, he quit Italy in 1834 yet returned to proceed with his battle in 1854. Italy was brought together in 1861, Rome, Lazio, and Trieste, after the First World War, were defeated in 1870.
    
    
    
    
    
    <p class="sub-title">The important Italian rulers</p>
    
    <p class="sub-title">Julius Caesar</p>
    
    An incredible general and statesmanship, Julius Caesar won a conventional war, which brought about the production of the Roman Empire, and in the making of a broad Roman standard, and a real existence tyrant. He was executed by rivals and is maybe the most acclaimed traditional creator.
    
    
    
    <p class="sub-title">Guiseppe Garibaldi</p> 
    
    Guiseppe Garibaldi was the pioneer of a few Italian wars of the nineteenth century following outcast to Latin America, set on him by his contribution in looking for a Republican uprising. At the point when he and his volunteer armed force of Redshirts conquered Sicily and Naples and enabled them to enter the Kingdom of Italy, he assumed a massive job in Italian unification. Garibaldi, even though he dropped out with the new ruler, won a request in the U.S in 1862. It never existed as Lincoln would not consent at that early point to abrogate subjection.
    
    
    <p class="sub-title">Benito Mussolini</p> 
    
    In 1922, in his fundamentalist association "Blackshirts," Benito Mussolini was Italy's most youthful executive. He changed his situation into a government, aligning himself to Hitler's Germanyinsight into Italian history, yet was constrained to leave after Italy betrayed him in the Second World War. He's been captured and taken off.

    <p class="sub-title">The Colosseum in Ancient Times</p>

    During the Roman Empire and under the motto of "Bread and Circuses" the Roman Colosseum (known then as Flavian Amphitheatre) allowed more than 50,000 people to enjoy its finest spectacles. The exhibitions of exotic animals, executions of prisoners, recreations of battles, and gladiator fights kept the Roman people entertained for years.

    The Colosseum remained active for over 500 years. The last recorded games in history were celebrated in the 6th century.

    Since the 6th century, the Colosseum has suffered lootings, earthquakes, and even bombings during World War Two. Demonstrating a great survival instinct, the Colosseum was used for decades as a storehouse, church, cemetery, and even a castle for nobility.

    <p class="sub-title">Flavian Amphitheatre</p> 

    The Roman Colosseum has not always been called “the Colosseum” as this modern name only dates back to the Middle Ages. It’s proper name is “Amphitheatrum Flavium” or Flavian’s Amphitheatre; in fact, you can still see the original name written on the Colosseum today. The Flavian Amphitheatre was named after the Flavian Dynasty, the emperors who commissioned its construction.

    But, how did the Colosseum get its modern name? The answer is still widely disputed between historians today. At 4 stories tall and with a capacity of over 50,000 spectators, its unprecedented size may have generated its colloquial name, “the Colosseum.” However, a number of historians believe that its name derived in reference to a “colossal” bronze statue of Nero as sun-god that once stood outside of the Amphitheatre.

    <p class="sub-title">Why was the Colosseum built?</p>

    Although it is true that one of the main reasons for the construction of the Colosseum was to symbolize the power of Rome and its emperors, the decision to build this amphitheater was taken in an attempt to make up for Nero’s extravagance, that had cost Rome the respect of its citizens. The rebellion by the Jews in Palestine against Roman rule provided the perfect chance to find the money needed to build the huge arena. After causing the great fire at Rome in AD 64 (but historians don’t agree completely that it was his fault) and causing a civil war four years later, emperor Nero had built a huge pleasure palace for himself (Domus Aurea, the Golden House) right in the centre of the city and it was there that Emperor Vespasian decided to build the Colosseum. He wanted to donate to the city a pleasure palace for the people that would house gladiator games. The Colosseum was inaugurated with 100 days of games and since the very start Vespasian decided admission would be free for everyone.

    <p class="sub-title"> How long did it take to build the Colosseum?</p>

    It took surprisingly just 8 years, from 72AD to 80AD, for the Roman Empire to complete the Colosseum. Though it was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian, this latter never saw it completed, as it only was inaugurated one year after his death. By that time Vespasian’s son Titus was in power. The short time needed to finish the immense amphitheater is justified by the huge number of people involved in the construction works. Thousands of slaves to lift and transport the materials, thousands of skilled and semi-skilled workers to handle the construction materials, not to mention the slaves that were working in the quarries to cut the stones. This all add up to a staff of at least 20,000 to 30,000 people.

    <p class="sub-title">Where was the Colosseum built?</p>

    Before Vespasian was Emperor of Rome, the Empire was ruled by Nero, a megalomaniac murderer who built himself the Domus Aurea, a massive, golden villa with a large, manmade lake, taking land away from the public. After Emperor Nero committed suicide, Emperor Vespasian built his Colosseum over the lake as a direct jab at his predecessor. He did this in a great effort to erase Nero’s memory, while also gaining loyalty and popularity in building something for the people and reestablishing Rome’s glory.

    Emptying the Domus Aurea’s large, manmade lake two thousand years ago was no easy task! Ancient engineers had to build canals to drain the water from the space. In doing this, they cleverly transformed them into a sewage system, which was useful for game days when over 50,000 spectators came to see the battles. These sewage systems were connected with terracotta and lead pipes that drained into the Tiber River. There is evidence of a truly advanced water and sewage system inside the Colosseum, including over 100 water fountains and two very large, communal latrines.

    Another fun fact… Before Domitian ordered the underground layer of the Colosseum to be constructed, the floor and its wooden supports could be removed, allowing the arena to be flooded. The ancient canals provide evidence that water was added back into the arena for mock naval battles inside the Colosseum, complete with mock warships!
